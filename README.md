# Rectangles.API

# Rectangles
# Practicalities
Your take-home coding exercise is designed to take about two to three hours to complete. <br />
You are under no obligation to take any specific amount of time to complete the task. <br />
# The rules
The code you write should be your own and should be written without direct assistance. <br />
However, feel free to use as many reference resources (Stack Overflow, MSDN, Google, <br />
textbooks) as you like. The task should be completed in C# or F#, and include unit tests to <br />
demonstrate the requirements have been met. <br />
Please submit your solution as a link to GitHub / BitBucket project. Ideally, it will contain <br />
project definitions, e.g. if using Visual Studio, provide a project that can easily be loaded and <br />
run. If any specific instructions are required, please include a readme. <br />
# The task
The task is to implement a system to track the position of a collection of rectangles on <br />
a grid that must support the following actions: <br />
● Create a grid <br />
● Place rectangles on the grid <br />
● Find a rectangle based on a given position <br />
● Remove a rectangle from the grid by specifying any point within the rectangle <br />
● [Optional] Display the grid and rectangles as ASCII art - this might help you with  
testing!
# Constraints
● A grid must have a width and height of no less than 5 and no greater than 25 <br />
● Positions on the grid are non-negative integer coordinates starting at 0 <br />
● Rectangles must not extend beyond the edge of the grid <br />
● Rectangles must not overlap
